# Contract Routing

Read the relevant contract BEFORE starting work. Not all contracts apply to every task.

## Role Boundary

Worker-Agent (WA) is product-implementation only.

WA must never perform governance development:

- `AGENTS.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `docs/contracts/**`
- `docs/qc/compiler/**`
- `docs/qc/scripts/**`
- `package.json`
- `.husky/**`

If a request requires governance changes, WA must stand down and wait for GA reactivation.

## Remote Branch Discipline

1. Use one work branch per task lifecycle from first edit until merge.
2. Do not split the same task across multiple branches.
3. Do not switch to a second branch mid-task to continue work.
4. If branch state is blocked, pause and ask operator; do not fork the task into another branch.

## Always

**Read:** `docs/contracts/commit.md`
**Read:** `docs/contracts/quality-gates.md`
**Read:** `docs/contracts/governance-compiler.md`
**Read:** `docs/contracts/capability-proof-guardrails.md`
**Read:** `docs/contracts/mid-task-termination.md`

### Required Task Staging

Before coding, create task spec:

- `docs/qc/specs/<task-id>.task.spec.json`

Spec must define:

1. capability
2. proof
3. guardrails

Before commit, ensure proof artifacts exist:

1. `docs/qc/proofs/<task-id>/proof.manifest.json`
2. `docs/qc/proofs/<task-id>/verdict.json` (written by compiler)
3. `docs/qc/proofs/<task-id>/oracles/*.json` and `docs/qc/proofs/<task-id>/raw/*` (written by compiler-owned harness custody)
4. `docs/qc/proofs/<task-id>.md`
5. `logs/compiler.log` contains hash-chained warning/error trail (auto-appended by compiler)

### Required Commands

1. Stage intended files only.
2. Run compiler:
   - `npm run gov:check -- --spec docs/qc/specs/<task-id>.task.spec.json`
   - do not manually generate oracle JSON files; compiler invokes harness directly and captures oracle payload in-memory
3. If compiler verdict is `FAIL`/`BLOCKED`/`ERROR`:
   - read the highest-severity diagnostic
   - apply one listed acceptable recipe
   - solve root cause only (no bypass/workaround edits)
   - rerun `gov:check` with the same spec
   - repeat until compiler verdict is `PASS`
   - if repeated remediation exposes a real contract/runtime conflict that cannot be resolved in-task, stop and ask operator for guidance before any further edits or commit attempts
4. If and only if compiler verdict is `PASS`, commit with:
   - `npm run gov:commit -- --spec docs/qc/specs/<task-id>.task.spec.json -m "type(scope): description"`
5. Immediately push the completion commit:
   - `git push origin HEAD`
6. Ensure there is an open PR for the current branch:
   - if PR exists: continue on the same PR
   - if PR does not exist: create one immediately targeting `main`
   - example: `gh pr create --base main --head <current-branch> --fill`

Direct `git commit` for product changes is non-compliant when compiler verdict is not `PASS`.

Compiler determines blocking gates from staged diff (`ci`, `e2e`, full contract/architecture gates, `audio:gates` when bound, and `gate:commit-range`).
Global-debt full scans remain non-blocking commands, but compiler debt ratchet is blocking:

1. product tasks must not increase global debt vs `docs/qc/debt/baseline.json`
2. debt-burn tasks must set `guardrails.require_debt_reduction=true` and reduce debt count by at least 1

### Operator Stand-Down Override

If operator says `stand down`, stop all work immediately and run:

- `npm run gov:standdown -- --task-id <task-id> --reason "<operator reason>"`

After stand-down:

1. do not edit
2. do not stage
3. do not commit
4. do not continue task work until explicit operator reactivation

## When changing audio code

Applies to: `src/engine/audio.ts`, any file in `src/engine/worklets/`, `src/engine/extensions/`.

**Read:** `docs/contracts/audio-determinism.md`

Compiler-bound requirements include:

- `npm run audio:gates`
- audio oracle artifacts (`off_transparent`, `on_audible`, `low_end_continuity`, `clip_guard`, `default_safety`)
- deterministic fixtures + fixed seed

## When changing benchmark path

Applies to: `tests/benchmark.html`, `src/engine/worklets/**`.

Task spec must declare:

1. `execution_profile: "real"`

Profile semantics:

1. `real` requires real process-time budget proof (`sample_count >= 50` and `p99 <= budget`)
2. do not introduce headless structural-only fallback; use display-backed runtime (`xvfb-run`) when needed

## When writing or modifying nonlinear audio processors

Applies to: compressor, saturation, waveshaper, tape emulation, transformer, and other nonlinear processors.

**Read:** `docs/contracts/adaptive-transfer.md`

## When changing colors, styles, or visual identity

Applies to: CSS in `index.html`, track colors, extension panel styling, grid cell colors, text colors.

**Read:** `docs/contracts/use-of-color.md`

## When changing app structure, features, or architecture

**Read:** `docs/contracts/architecture-invariants.md`
**Update:** `README.md`

## When running on-demand QC

**Read:** `docs/qc/baseline.md`
Default reviewed range is `baseline_sha..HEAD`.

**Inspect:** commits and `docs/qc/proofs/*.md`
QC is evidence inspection unless explicitly asked to rerun gates.

**Write:** `docs/qc/runs/<timestamp>-<headsha>.md`
Include:

- reviewed commit range
- commit list
- contract/gate matrix (`PASS | FAIL | BLOCKED`)
- blocker evidence
- final verdict

**Update:** `docs/qc/baseline.md`
Advance `baseline_sha` only when final verdict is `PASS`.

## Debt Burn-Down Mode

When asked to eliminate global debt:

1. pick one baseline finding from `docs/qc/debt/baseline.json`
2. set `guardrails.require_debt_reduction=true` in task spec
3. complete only when compiler debt ratchet shows strict negative delta
